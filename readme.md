 This was an attempt at improving [Leprechaun](https://www.github.com/michaellormann/leprechaun). The main goal was to use AI to handle trading logic. I didn't get to complete it, so feel free to go through the code and do as you like with it. I only hope anyone who does make a complete version makes it open source.
